            <h2>A Platform for Software Engineering Students and Software Engineering Projects</h2>
            <p>WPI Suite is a platform for hosting tools for software engineering teams as well as a platform that can be used as a basis for software
                engineering course projects. WPI Suite has evolved from software engineering course projects at Worcester Polytechnic Institute over several
                years. The projects were assigned in Professor Gary Pollice's software engineering course, CS3733. The current suite is a complete rewrite and
                redesign that was created as a pair of senior Major Qualifying Projects (MQPs) during the 2012-13 academic year.</p>
