{"name":"WPI Suite","tagline":"A platform for software engineering students and software engineering projects","body":"# Welcome to WPI Suite\r\nWPI Suite is a platform for hosting tools for software engineering teams as well as a platform that can be used as a basis for software engineering course projects. WPI Suite has evolved from software engineering course projects at Worcester Polytechnic Institute over several years. The projects were\r\nassigned in Prof. Gary Pollice's software engineering course, CS3733. The current suite is a complete rewrite and redesign that was created as a pair of senior Major Qualifying Projects (MQPs) during the 2012-13 academic year. The results of this project can be found in the (coming soon) original project repository.\r\n\r\nThe projects were completed by:\r\n* Chris Casola\r\n* Michael Della Donna\r\n* Brian Gaffey\r\n* Ryan Hamer\r\n* Andrew Hurle\r\n* Jennifer Page\r\n* Tyler Wack\r\n\r\n## Contents\r\nTBD\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
